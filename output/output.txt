Gaps: limited explicit robotics/SLAM/perception or embedded-systems domain experience, no documented lead role in venture fundraising or IPO preparation, and limited explicit evidence of hiring large engineering teams for core autonomy stacks. Seniority, cross-functional management, and scaling experience align well with the role."
