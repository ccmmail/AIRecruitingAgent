Clear strengths: product org building, GTM alignment, pricing/monetization, ML/AI, M&A/PMI, P&L ownership and leading large teams (90–140). Gaps: limited explicit evidence of infrastructure/networking/edge/distributed-systems product ownership, security-focused enterprise product sales to technical buyers (DevOps/SRE/CISO), and explicit ownership of Product Marketing, Documentation and Product Operations at scale. With targeted reframing and 1–2 clarifying examples (infrastructure/enterprise sales or technical product launches), candidate is a strong fit."
