    "score": 8,
    "rationale": "Strong product/operator leader with repeat startup and scale experience, P&L and GTM track record, hands-on ML/product delivery (founded data science/ML teams), and proven ability to recruit and run large cross-functional orgs. Has an active investor network (Silicon Valley Angels, Benchmark, Sequoia) and advisor role in early-stage investing to support seed raise. Key gaps: no explicit record of personally leading/closing a seed round and limited explicit Generative AI model/architecture details and documented HIPAA/regulatory product execution. Best positioned as a product-led, technical CEO/co-founder who will own vision, product-market fit with early customers, and lead seed fundraising leveraging investor network and advisor support."
