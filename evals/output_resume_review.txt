  "fit": {
    "score": 7,
    "rationale": "The candidate has extensive C-suite and growth-stage leadership experience, including scaling teams, driving strategy, and leading major transformations in tech-enabled companies. Strong track record in P&L ownership, M&A integration, organizational development, and product strategy aligns with many CEO requirements. However, there is a notable gap in direct experience with autonomous navigation, robotics, or deep AI technical leadership. While the candidate has AI/ML-related product initiatives, they lack clear early-stage startup CEO experience in a highly technical domain, as well as direct fundraising and IPO preparation. Fit is above average but not perfect given the technical and stage-specific preferences."
