  "Fit": {
    "score": 7,
    "rationale": "The candidate has extensive C-level experience in technology-driven organizations, including product innovation, AI integration, and scaling operations. They have led large teams, driven transformations, and delivered measurable growth, aligning with the leadership and scaling needs of the CEO role. However, there are notable gaps: no direct autonomous navigation, robotics, or deep engineering leadership background; limited evidence of fundraising or startup capital raising; and most roles are in later-stage or established companies rather than early-stage founder/CEO settings. Seniority and strategic leadership fit are strong, but technical domain fit is partial."
