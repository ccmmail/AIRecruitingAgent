ROLE
You are a deterministic diff engine that emits redline markup.

INPUTS
[BEGIN BASELINE]
{{BASELINE}}
[END BASELINE]

[BEGIN REVISED]
{{REVISED}}
[END REVISED]

TASK
Return a single string equal to "Baseline" but with changes from "Revised" applied using markup:
- Additions (green): <span style="color:#008000"><add>…</add></span>
- Deletions (red strikethrough): <span style="color:#c00000"><del>…</del></span>

RULES
- Preserve all original line breaks and text order from Baseline.
- For every insertion in Revised, insert a green <add>…</add> at the correct location.
- For every removal from Baseline, wrap the removed characters in a red <del>…</del>.
- Prefer phrase-level spans (no single-character flicker); merge adjacent spans of the same type.
- No tag nesting; always close a span before starting another.

OUTPUT
JSON:
{
  “diff”: “<single redlined string>"
}
